Financial Statements:

    Balance Sheet Formulas:
        Total Assets = Current Assets + Non-Current Assets
        Total Liabilities = Current Liabilities + Non-Current Liabilities
        Equity = Total Assets - Total Liabilities (or Equity = Contributed Capital + Retained Earnings)

    Income Statement Formulas:
        Revenue = Price x Quantity (or sum of revenues from each revenue stream)
        Total Expenses = Cost of Goods Sold + Operating Expenses + Non-Operating Expenses
        Net Income = Revenue - Total Expenses

    Cash Flow Statement Formulas:
        Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = Cash Inflows - Cash Outflows from Operating Activities
        Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = Cash Inflows - Cash Outflows from Investing Activities
        Net Cash Flow from Financing Activities = Cash Inflows - Cash Outflows from Financing Activities
        Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities + Net Cash Flow from Financing Activities

Ratios and Financial Analysis:

    Liquidity Ratios:
        Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
        Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities

    Profitability Ratios:
        Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Revenue) x 100
        Net Profit Margin = (Net Income / Revenue) x 100
        Return on Equity (ROE) = (Net Income / Shareholders' Equity) x 100

    Leverage Ratios:
        Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Equity
        Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense

Budgeting and Forecasting:

    Budgeting Formulas:
        Total Budgeted Revenue = Budgeted Price x Budgeted Quantity (or sum of revenue budgets)
        Total Budgeted Expenses = Sum of all budgeted expense categories
        Budgeted Net Income = Total Budgeted Revenue - Total Budgeted Expenses

    Forecasting Techniques:
        Simple Moving Average = (Sum of Data Points in Periods) / (Number of Periods)
        Weighted Moving Average = (Weighted Sum of Data Points) / (Total Weight)
        Exponential Smoothing = (Previous Period's Forecast x Smoothing Factor) + (Actual Value x (1 - Smoothing Factor))

Other Important Formulas:

    Depreciation:
        Straight-Line Depreciation = (Initial Cost - Salvage Value) / Useful Life
        Double-Declining Balance Depreciation = (2 / Useful Life) x Book Value at Beginning of Year

    Interest and Time Value of Money:

    Simple Interest = Principal x Interest Rate x Time
    Future Value = Present Value x (1 + Interest Rate)^n
    Present Value = Future Value / (1 + Interest Rate)^n

These formulas cover a wide range of financial calculations and analyses commonly used in bookkeeping and accounting. Remember to adapt these formulas based on the specific requirements and accounting standards of your organization or industry.
